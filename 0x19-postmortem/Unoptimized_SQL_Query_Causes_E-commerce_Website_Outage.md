Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: July 15, 2023, 03:45 AM (UTC)
End Time: July 15, 2023, 05:30 AM (UTC)
Impact:
The outage affected our e-commerce website, resulting in slow response times and intermittent service disruptions.
Users experienced delays in page loading and some reported difficulties in completing transactions.
Approximately 15% of our users were affected during the peak hours.
Timeline:

Issue Detection:

Detected at 03:45 AM (UTC) through automated monitoring alerts indicating a surge in error rates and response time delays.
Actions Taken:

Engineering team immediately initiated an investigation into the issue.
Assumed root cause to be a possible database overload due to an unusually high number of concurrent user sessions.
Investigated database servers, application servers, and network infrastructure for anomalies.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Initially focused on the database as the likely culprit, but in-depth analysis revealed that it was not the primary issue.
Considered potential DDoS attacks, which were later ruled out as traffic patterns did not match typical attack profiles.
Escalation:

As the issue persisted and user impact increased, the incident was escalated to the Senior System Reliability Engineer and Database Administrator.
Resolution:

Identified the root cause as an unoptimized SQL query that caused excessive load on the database server.
The problematic query was optimized and fine-tuned to improve database performance.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was an unoptimized SQL query used in a critical e-commerce transaction process.
This query triggered cascading performance issues as it resulted in high database CPU and memory usage.
Resolution:

The problematic SQL query was rewritten to enhance its efficiency.
Database indexing and caching strategies were adjusted to prevent similar issues in the future.
A performance monitoring system was implemented to alert on resource-intensive queries.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Conduct a comprehensive review of all critical SQL queries and optimize where necessary.
Enhance the load testing process to simulate high concurrent user loads and identify performance bottlenecks in advance.
Implement automated scaling of database resources during traffic spikes to mitigate resource contention.
Tasks:

Specific tasks to address the issue:
Rewrite and optimize the remaining high-impact SQL queries within the application code.
Enhance database server resource allocation and fine-tune configurations for better performance.
Develop and implement automated performance testing scripts that replicate real-world traffic patterns.
Establish clear incident escalation procedures for prompt response to future outages.
Create a knowledge-sharing session within the team to disseminate lessons learned from this incident.
